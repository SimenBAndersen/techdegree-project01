# techdegree-project01
Random Quote Generator

This is the first of 12 projects that I will be doing through Treehouse's Fullstack Javascript Techdegree. 

In this project:
- Creates an array of objects that includes information about a quote, it's source and other relevant information. 
- By clicking on a button on the page, a new random quote in the array will be shown. 
- All quotes will be shown once before anyone is shown a second time
- Also changes the background color everytime a quote is generated
